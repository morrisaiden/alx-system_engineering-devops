Connecting to a web server via SSH (Secure Shell) is a common method used to manage and interact with remote servers securely. Below is a detailed explanation of how to connect to a web server via SSH:

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely access and manage remote servers over an encrypted connection. It provides a secure alternative to protocols like Telnet and FTP, which transmit data, including passwords, in plain text.

Prerequisites:

1. SSH Client: Ensure that you have an SSH client installed on your local machine. Most Linux distributions and macOS come with an SSH client pre-installed. For Windows, you can use applications like PuTTY or the built-in OpenSSH client available in Windows 10.

2. SSH Key Pair: To authenticate securely without entering a password each time, it's recommended to use SSH key-based authentication. This involves generating an SSH key pair consisting of a private key and a public key. The public key is added to the remote server, and the private key remains on your local machine.

Steps to Connect to a Web Server via SSH:

1. Generate SSH Key Pair (Optional but Recommended):
If you don't already have an SSH key pair, you can generate one using the following command: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

2.  Copy Public Key to Remote Server (Optional but Recommended):
If you've generated a new SSH key pair, you'll need to copy the public key to the remote server to enable key-based authentication

3. Connect to Remote Server via SSH:
Once the SSH key pair is set up, you can connect to the remote server

4. If you've set a passphrase for your SSH key (optional), you'll be prompted to enter it. Otherwise, if you didn't set a passphrase, you'll be logged into the remote server directly.

5.Once connected, you'll be logged into the remote server via SSH, and you can start executing commands on the remote server as if you were physically at the machine.
