Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers allow developers to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package. This ensures that the application will run the same regardless of where it's deployed.

Docker has become extremely popular in the DevOps and cloud computing communities because of its ability to simplify the development, deployment, and scaling of applications. It's widely used in both development and production environments across various industries.
