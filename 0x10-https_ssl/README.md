HTTP Secure, commonly abbreviated as HTTPS, is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used for secure communication over a computer network, particularly the internet. HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between a web browser and a website, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the information transmitted. This is achieved through the use of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols.

When a website is accessed via HTTPS, the communication between the browser and the server is encrypted, which prevents eavesdropping and tampering by malicious actors. This is particularly important for sensitive transactions, such as online banking, e-commerce purchases, and data exchange in secure applications.

To enable HTTPS on a website, a digital certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) is required. This certificate verifies the identity of the website and allows the browser to establish a secure connection. HTTPS is indicated in the URL of a website by "https://" instead of "http://", and modern browsers typically display a padlock icon to signify a secure connection.

In summary, HTTPS provides a secure and encrypted method for transmitting data over the internet, ensuring privacy and security for both users and website owners.
