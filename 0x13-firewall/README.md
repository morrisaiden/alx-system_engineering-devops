A firewall is like a virtual barrier between your computer or network and the internet, designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a filter, allowing or blocking data packets based on various criteria such as IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, and more. Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software forms and are essential for network security, helping to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.
