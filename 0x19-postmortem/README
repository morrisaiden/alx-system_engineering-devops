stmortem: The Great Nginx Mishap of 2024
Issue Summary
Duration:
Start: 2024-06-05 14:00 UTC
End: 2024-06-05 16:30 UTC
Impact:
Our beloved web application was down, leaving users with the charming 503 Service Unavailable error. Approximately 80% of our users experienced the horror. Panic ensued. Cats and dogs living together. Mass hysteria.
Root Cause:
A botched Nginx load balancer configuration during a routine deployment sent our traffic into the void. Yes, it was as fun as it sounds.
Timeline
14:00 UTC: Monitoring alert: "503 errors are spiking!" screamed our dashboard.
14:05 UTC: On-call engineers sprang into action, caffeine-fueled and ready.
14:10 UTC: "It must be the database!" someone shouted. (Spoiler: It wasn’t.)
14:20 UTC: Database team gave a thumbs-up. The database was fine.
14:30 UTC: Misleading path: "Maybe it’s the application servers?" Nope, all good.
15:00 UTC: DevOps team entered the fray. "It’s gotta be Nginx," they deduced.
15:15 UTC: Nginx configuration rollback initiated. Fingers crossed.
15:30 UTC: Still broken. Cue the sad trombone.
16:00 UTC: Eureka! A missing environment variable (UPSTREAM_SERVER) found.
16:15 UTC: Fixed the config. Re-deployed. Held our breath.
16:30 UTC: Success! Services restored. Time for a celebratory coffee.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
During our routine deployment at 13:50 UTC, a gremlin slipped into our Nginx configuration. It missed an essential environment variable (UPSTREAM_SERVER). Instead of routing traffic like a good little load balancer, Nginx threw up its virtual hands and gave everyone 503 errors.
Resolution:
We heroically:
Rolled back the Nginx config (which helped but didn’t solve everything).
Spotted the missing UPSTREAM_SERVER variable.
Updated the config, deployed the fix, and basked in the glory of restored service.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
More stringent validation for configuration files pre-deployment to catch any missing variables.
Enhanced monitoring to scream at us even louder if Nginx goes rogue again.
Tasks:
Patch Nginx Configuration:
Update deployment scripts to include validation steps for all required environment variables.
Enhance Monitoring:
Implement new monitoring checks for Nginx configuration integrity.
Add alerts for unusual traffic patterns or error spikes indicating potential routing issues.
Review and Document Deployment Procedures:
Review current deployment procedures and document detailed steps to ensure critical configurations are not overlooked.
Training and Awareness:
Conduct a training session for the DevOps and engineering teams on the importance of configuration validation and monitoring.
Post-Deployment Verification:
Establish a post-deployment verification process to confirm successful deployment and proper functioning of all components immediately after any updates.
And that, dear readers, is how we survived the Great Nginx Mishap of 2024. Remember, always double-check your configs, keep your monitoring sharp, and never underestimate the power of a missing environment variable!
