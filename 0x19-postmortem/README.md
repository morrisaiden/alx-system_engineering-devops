stmortem: Web Application Outage
Issue Summary
Duration:
Start: 2024-06-05 14:00 UTC
End: 2024-06-05 16:30 UTC
Impact:
The main service, a web application, was down. Users experienced 503 Service Unavailable errors. Approximately 80% of the users were affected.
Root Cause:
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer following a routine deployment, which caused all incoming traffic to be routed incorrectly.
Timeline
14:00 UTC: Issue detected through a monitoring alert indicating a spike in 503 errors.
14:05 UTC: Engineers on-call confirmed the issue and initiated an investigation.
14:10 UTC: Initial assumption was that the database server was down due to previous similar incidents.
14:20 UTC: Database team confirmed the database was functioning normally.
14:30 UTC: Misleading path: Investigated possible issues with the application servers, including checking for memory leaks and CPU spikes.
15:00 UTC: Incident escalated to the DevOps team after application server checks showed no issues.
15:15 UTC: DevOps team identified that a recent Nginx configuration update might be the cause.
15:30 UTC: Rolled back the Nginx configuration to the previous version.
16:00 UTC: Issue persisted, further analysis indicated a missing environment variable in the Nginx config.
16:15 UTC: Corrected the Nginx configuration, including the missing environment variable.
16:30 UTC: Service fully restored, monitoring confirmed normal operations.



Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The outage was caused by an incorrect Nginx configuration update deployed at 13:50 UTC. The update lacked an essential environment variable (UPSTREAM_SERVER) needed for proper traffic routing. This resulted in all incoming requests being misrouted, leading to 503 Service Unavailable errors for users.
Resolution:
The issue was resolved by:
Rolling back to the previous Nginx configuration, which temporarily alleviated some of the routing issues but did not completely resolve the outage.
Identifying and correcting the missing UPSTREAM_SERVER variable in the configuration.
Redeploying the corrected Nginx configuration and verifying the restoration of normal service.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Implement additional validation checks for configuration files before deployment to catch missing or incorrect parameters.
Enhance monitoring to detect and alert on misconfigurations in real-time.
Tasks:
Patch Nginx Configuration:
Update the deployment scripts to include validation steps for all required environment variables.
Enhance Monitoring:
Implement new monitoring checks specifically for Nginx configuration integrity.
Add alerts for unusual traffic patterns or error spikes indicating potential routing issues.
Review and Document Deployment Procedures:
Conduct a review of current deployment procedures and document detailed steps to ensure critical configurations are not overlooked.
Training and Awareness:
Organize a training session for the DevOps and engineering teams to understand the importance of configuration validation and monitoring.
Post-Deployment Verification:
Establish a post-deployment verification process to confirm successful deployment and proper functioning of all components immediately after any updates.
By addressing these areas, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a more resilient and reliable deployment process.
